# TxHotstuff

This repository includes prototype code implementing a transactional key-value store "TxHotstuff" as BFT baseline system to compare against Basil. TxHotstuff implements distributed transactions and atomic commit atop libhotstuff, an open source BFT state machine replication library implementing the Hotstuff protocol. More information on Hotstuff can be found here: https://github.com/hot-stuff/libhotstuff

Please refer to the READMe on branch "main" for instructions on how to build and evaluate the system.
