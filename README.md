# TxBFTSmart

This repository includes prototype code implementing a transactional key-value store "TxBFTSmart" as BFT baseline system to compare against Basil. TxBFTSmart implements distributed transactions and atomic commit atop BFTSMaRT, an open source BFT state machine replication library implementing a full-fledged adaptation of the PBFT consensus protocol. More information on BFTSMaRT can be found here: https://github.com/bft-smart/library

Please refer to the READMe on branch "main" for instructions on how to build and evaluate the system.
