\section{Implementation and Evaluation}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Experiments}
-Comparison vs Tapir
-Evaluation of the signature and proofs overheads.
-(Evaluation of performance under view changes: should show that its not affected too much)
-(Comparison against our own system but with Validation doing Atomic Broadcast)
-(Comparison against Hyperledger?)


\subsection{Notes}
What experiments do we want? Phrase as questions


How much more expensive is it do do it in BFT? Compare with Tapir
When does our system suck: congestion
Evaluation of the signature and proofs overheads.
(Evaluation of performance under view changes: should show that its not affected too much)
(Comparison against our own system but with Validation doing Atomic Broadcast)
Sclalability when multisharding
(Comparison against Hyperledger?)
