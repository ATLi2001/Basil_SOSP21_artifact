1. Explain or prove how we satisfy byzantine independence and why we want it:

byz participants cannot reactively make aborts happen if they do not control the network. 
This is stronger than a leader based setting.  A byzantine leader can always reactively create a conflicting TX. An honest leader would not do this. 
Thus we are equivalent to an honest leader.

(If you know the keys beforehand it is possible to create mutually aborting transactions to form dependencies. But this requires additional knowledge; arguably dependent on the network too).


2. Can use witnesses instead of full replicas to reduce replication cost. Those need to only contain key/version and no values.
