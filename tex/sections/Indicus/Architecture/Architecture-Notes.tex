\section{Arch-Notes}

\paragraph{Goals:}

- Indicus should be a transactional database\\
- It should be replicated and tolerate Byzantine behavior for fault tolerance and trust assumptions\\
- It should offer the most general set of transactions, i.e. Interactive Transactions\\
- It should enforce ACID guarantees, specifically Serialiability as Isolation level\\
- It should not be affected by censorship\\
- It should enforce only a partial order on Transations\\
- Leaderless\\
- Shardable\\

\paragraph{Challenges}
- Byzantine behavior requires additional safety precautions; higher replication degree\\
- Providing interactive Transactions requires offering Clients an interface for execution.\\
- Enforcing only a partial order implies the necessity of conflict checks. Concretely, maintaining serializability requires the use of Concurrency control.\\
- If we want no total order and no censorship then we cannot have a leader. This means empowering Clients which is dangerous in a byzantine system: exposes more opportunities for misbehavior.\\
- No leader means replicas may go out of sync, need to maintain consistency view of the database somehow\\
- Multi-shard transactions require additional coordination\\
