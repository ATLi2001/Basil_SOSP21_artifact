\subsubsection{System properties}
We offer Clients an interactive Transaction interface that implements ACID transactions. While all ACID guarantees may be violated by individual byzantine Replicas, the system maintains the illusion of an ACID compliant state to all honest Clients.
Moreover, we guarantee to Clients that the Database is \textit{byzantine Serializable} as defined below. Intuitively this Isolation level guarantees that all honest Clients experience the Database as if there serializable. In order to formally capture this we lay some ground work: \footnote{Defs for commands etc in accordance with BFT DUr. cite}\\

Let $Op =  \{r, w\} \times K \times V $ and $Dec = \{Commit, \,Abort\}$ be the sets of possible operations and decisions respectively, where $K$ is the set of existing data items (keys) and $V$ the range of possible values. A \textit{request} $req \in (Op \cup Dec) \times C$ maps any such operation or decision to the issuing Client from set $C$. We denote with $Hon \subseteq C$ the subset of honest Clients. \\

\textbf{History H.} Informally, a \textit{H} contains the operations (read/write) and decisions (commit/abort) of every transaction issued in the system. Formally, we define a \textit{history H} as a finite sequence of requests.\\

We define a projection $H|_c$ as the subsequence of requests in $H$ that were issued by Client $c$. A sequence of requests $s = req_i \dots req_{i+t}$ in $H|_c$ form a \textit{Transaction} if $req_i$ is the first request by Client $c$ or $req_{i-1} \in Dec \times c$, and if $req_{i+t} \in Dec \times c$.\\

We further define:\\

\textbf{Honest History H(P).} Given protocol P, A \textit{history H} is \textit{honest} if it was generated by participants who all follow P. I.e. concretely, $H(P) \equiv H = H|_{Hon}$.
and\\

\textbf{Honest-View Equivalent.} A \textit{history H} is honest-view equivalent to a $history H'$ if the Operations and Decisions of all honest Clients are the same and if the final writes are the same.\\

\textbf{Byz-I} Given a protocol $P$ and an isolation level $I$:
A history H is \textit{byzantine-I} if there exists an honest history \textit{H'} such that H is honest-view equivalent to H' and H' satisfies I. \\

Thus, informally a byzantine Isolation level states that the state that honest Clients experience must be explicable by an execution in which all participants were honest. Note, that we make no assumptions on the state a byzantine client \textit{chooses} to experience; i.e. byzantine Clients may read arbitrarily.
This definition captures the requirements for any byzantine tolerant protocol that strives to maintain Isolation level I.\\

We further define the ideal progress properties to limit the influence Byzantine Clients have on system throughput. \\

\textbf{Byzantine Independence}
Given a protocol $P$ and an honest Client $c$. The result of a request $r$ issued by $c$ cannot be determinsistically decided by byzantine participants.  \\

If the network is controlled by an adversary, this property is unattainable for Indicus. 
In order to offer this property we must strengthen our assumption on the network. Concretely, while the network may be asynchronous, the adversary does not control the network, and hence, may not reliably impact results. \\
An exception to this are wide-ranged flooding attacks (ddos) which are beyond the scope of this work.
We point out, that a strawman system offering interactive transactions and speculative execution while relying on Atomic Broadcast for Validation ordering suffers the same fallacy: A byzantine leader may always frontrun requests. In fact, even with strengthened network assumptions, such a a system could not offer Byzantine Independence.\\
%We point out, that in fact no system that speculates on execution, and hence may incur aborts, can enjoy \textit{Byzantine Independence}. Not true since in theory one could imagine a scheme that uses "committment certification", but this is impractical


We adapt and define gracious and uncivil executions based on cite(aardvark) to match our model. (i.e. network not sync either).
\textbf{Gracious Execution}
An execution is gracious iff (a) the execution is synchronous with some
implementation-dependent short bound on message delay (b) all clients and servers behave correctly and (c) there is no contention on the objects relevant to the execution.
\textbf{Uncivil}
An execution is uncivil iff (a) there is no bound on message delay (asynchrony) and (b) up to f servers and an arbitrary number of clients are Byzantine 


\subsection{Assumptions on Behaviors}
Clients can do what they want, but we assume there is access control to bound the reach. We dont expect clients to explicitly try to circumvent others progress (this requires knowledge of what they are doing in the first place).
We expect a level of performance, if you dont meet it you are not fit for the system.
Replicas can enforce such access lists, i.e. via timeouts of blacklists.
unlikely that a Client can lock out a lot of the system, would mean he has total access control.
