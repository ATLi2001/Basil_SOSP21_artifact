\section{Definition- notes}

\paragraph{Goals:}

- Define what liveness guarantees there should be in a byz system\\
- Want to offer interactive ACID TX in a byz setting \\
- be robust to byz contention\\


\paragraph{Challenges}
- Clients can intertwine their fate with byz participants. When can/should liveness be guaranteed and when should it not. Under which network assumptions?\\
-  Unclear what correct behavior should be. Thus, we need to define what ACID (specifically Isolation) means in a byzantine context. byzantine Clients can execute arbitrary transactions, might not care for guarantees. Begs the question: Should one enforce "safety" for them too?\\
- What does it mean to be robust to byz contention? To what extent is independence possible
