\fs{since this only affect validation, maybe move it there.}
\sys comes in two different flavors, \sys{}3 and \sys{}5 respectively, that rely on varying replication degrees, but implement the same design. \sys{}3 requires $n=3f+1$ replicas \fs{, the minimum bound necessary for BFT SMR?,} per shard to guarantee consistency in the presence of $\leq f$ byzantine replicas. \sys{}5 reduces both latencies during failure free execution and complexity during recovery. \footnote{We believe that consortiums with high performance requirements or high replication degrees are respectively comfortable with paying for additional replicas or tolerating a lower fraction (1/3 vs 1/5) of failures}
For the simplicity of exposition we discuss \sys{}5 for the remainder of the paper, and defer to section X \fs{and/or TR} to describe differences in \sys{}3. In the following, we outline \sys 's execution (unaffected by replication degree), validation and writeback protocols.
