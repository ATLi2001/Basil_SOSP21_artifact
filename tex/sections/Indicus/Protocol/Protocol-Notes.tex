\section{Protocol-Notes}

\subsection{TX execution}
Goal:\\
- clients should be able to read valid and consistent data from the database\\
- clients should see the most recent data\\


Challenge\\
- Replicas can be out of sync and byzantine\\
- There might be concurrent transactions ongoing that are conflicting\\



\subsection{Concurrency control}
Goal: \\
- limit aborts\\

challenges:\\
- concurrent read/writes. Maintain isolation: serializability\\
- geo-distributed so execution and validation takes long --> more interleavings\\
- clocks are not perfectly synced\\
- minimize unecessary aborts\\
- byzantine clients can create artificial congestion\\


\subsection{Validation}
Goal:\\
- maintain ACID guarantees: Isolation, Durability, Atomicity\\
- Be client driven, i.e. leaderless and out of order\\
- avoid frontrunning\\
- be scalable
- be fast

Challenges:\\
- Maintain Isolation while creating highest chance to commit\\
- Tolerate byzantine replicas voting dishonestly\\
- Tolerate Client failures: equivocation, crashes, stalling, replay\\
--> Answer: make final decisions idempotent\\
- enable consistent recovery
- minimize state at replicas while still guaranteeing correct agreement. Make sure local knowledge is enough to guarantee global correctness
- minimize necessary roundtrips and communication complexity



\subsection{Writeback}
Goal: \\
- Finalize commit/aborts\\
- Maintain consistency\\
- Enable garbage collection\\

Challenges:\\
- client failures (crash, equivocation)\\
- 


\subsection{Optimizations}
Goals:\\
- reduce write aborts\\
- reduce redundancy in validation\\
- reduce read lock impact (byz clients)\\

Challenges:\\
- defend against byz client abuse\\
- respect all shard results\\
- 

\subsection{Failures}
Goals:\\
- be robust to byzantine client\\


challenges:\\
- byzantine clients can stall or equivocate during Validation/Writeback\\
- Granting honest clients liveness --> ability to "realiably" finish all Transactions.\\
