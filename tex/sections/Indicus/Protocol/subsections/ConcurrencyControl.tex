\subsection{Concurrency Control}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Optimization: retries - heights
 - Dependency resolution tree
 		- Equivocation not possible if TXidentifier a function with dep as argument
 		- Cannot claim dep if not f+1 times (If you want to, you would require proofs again, which we try to avoid because dep trees can grow exponentially). More reads also more likely to commit --> f+1 guarantees 1 honest thinks it is legit.
 - Exception for depedency and early async read response to inform of exceptions
 - Read leases instead of unlimited locks - in practice only grant to timely clients (not a safety measure, but an increased progress guarantee)
