- Fallback: election (only starts if not waiting on another dep to avoid early eviction), views, resolution, subtelties with mvtso (block because of dep), necessity even without dependencies. Interested clients, write-back multishard. garbage collection
- Fallback requires an extra round in order to learn about current views to start viewchange, but thats ok: Its co-function with learning about full TX, and checking for existing certificates. Timeout invocation is concurrent with p1 message.
