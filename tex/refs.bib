  abstract = { We discuss relationships between client-centric consistency models (known as session guarantees), and data-centric consistency models. The first group includes: read-your-writes guarantee, monotonic-writes guarantee, monotonic-reads guarantee and writes-follow-reads guarantee. The other group includes: atomic consistency, sequential consistency, causal consistency, processor consistency, PRAM consistency, weak consistency, release consistency, scope consistency and entry consistency. We use a consistent notation to present formal definitions of both kinds of consistency models in the context of replicated shared objects. Next, we prove a relationship between causal consistency model and client-centric consistency models. Apparently, causal consistency is similar to writes-follow-reads guarantee. We show that in fact causal consistency requires all common session guarantees, i.e. read-your-writes, monotonic-writes, monotonic-reads and writes-follow-reads to be preserved.},

  abstract        = {The problem of naming and locating objects in a
                 distributed environment is considered, and the
                 clearinghouse, a decentralized agent for supporting the
                 naming of these ``network-visible'' objects, is
                 described. The objects ``known'' to the clearinghouse
                 are of many types and include workstations, file
                 servers, print servers, mail servers, clearinghouse
                 servers, and human user. All objects known to the
                 clearinghouse are named using the same convention, and
                 the clearinghouse provides information about objects in
                 a uniform fashion, regardless of their type. The
                 clearinghouse also supports aliases. The clearinghouse
                 binds a name to a set of properties of various types.
                 For instance, the name of a user may be associated with
                 the location of his local workstation, mailbox, and
                 nonlocation information such as password and comments.
                 The clearinghouse is decentralized and replicated. That
                 is, instead of one global clearinghouse server, there
                 are many local clearinghouse servers, each storing a
                 copy of a portion of the global database. The totality
                 of services supplied by these clearinghouse servers is
                 called the clearinghouse. Decentralization and
                 replication increase efficiency, security, and
                 reliability. A request to the clearinghouse to bind a
                 name to its set of properties may originate anywhere in
                 the system and be directed to any clearinghouse server.
                 A clearinghouse client need not be concerned with the
                 question of which clearinghouse server actually
                 contains the binding -- the clearinghouse stub in the

@article{Oppen83Clearinghouse,
	Abstract = {The problem of naming and locating objects in a
                 distributed environment is considered, and the
                 clearinghouse, a decentralized agent for supporting the
                 naming of these ``network-visible'' objects, is
                 described. The objects ``known'' to the clearinghouse
                 are of many types and include workstations, file
                 servers, print servers, mail servers, clearinghouse
                 servers, and human user. All objects known to the
                 clearinghouse are named using the same convention, and
                 the clearinghouse provides information about objects in
                 a uniform fashion, regardless of their type. The
                 clearinghouse also supports aliases. The clearinghouse
                 binds a name to a set of properties of various types.
                 For instance, the name of a user may be associated with
                 the location of his local workstation, mailbox, and
                 nonlocation information such as password and comments.
                 The clearinghouse is decentralized and replicated. That
                 is, instead of one global clearinghouse server, there
                 are many local clearinghouse servers, each storing a
                 copy of a portion of the global database. The totality
                 of services supplied by these clearinghouse servers is
                 called the clearinghouse. Decentralization and
                 replication increase efficiency, security, and
                 reliability. A request to the clearinghouse to bind a
                 name to its set of properties may originate anywhere in
                 the system and be directed to any clearinghouse server.
                 A clearinghouse client need not be concerned with the
                 question of which clearinghouse server actually
                 contains the binding -- the clearinghouse stub in the
                 client in conjunction with distributed clearinghouse
                 servers automatically finds the mapping if it exists.
                 Updates to the various copies of a mapping may occur
                 asynchronously and be interleaved with requests for
                 bindings of names to properties; updates to the various
                 copies are not treated as indivisible transactions. Any
                 resulting inconsistency between the various copies is
                 only transient: the clearinghouse automatically
                 arbitrates between conflicting updates to restore
                 consistency.},
